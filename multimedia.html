         to discribe iframe it is used to bring content of other website to the user page. the below video is from youtube where I copied the iframe and paste <br>it in html code. Not just video, it can be from text content to search engine. you need to be careful when using iframe dont use to hack<br> or cheating dont use copywrite content. to get youtube video select video on youtube select share whic is at the bottom of the video<br> select embed option copy from &lt;iframe&gt; to &lt;/iframe&gt; and paste direcly inside html. you can tweak using css.

       <h4>God songs</h4>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="audio\God songs\Alaioli.mp3"target="_blank">Alaioli</a></li>
       <li><a href="audio\God songs\Azhakin mulumai.mp3"target="_blank">Azhakin mulumai</a></li>
      </ul>

       <p>what I found here is without using audio tag controls and source you can play audio file using &lt;a href&gt; to play the audio. Automatically controls is assigned<br>
          Here i used target ="_blank so the audio plays in next tab of the browser.And also unordred list.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
       <audio controls >
          <source src="audio\God songs\Adhisayangal.mp3"> 
          <source src="audio\God songs\Amaithien Thoothanai.mp3">
       </audio>
   </div>
   <div>
       <p>OK now i used audio tag with controls it worked for only first audio source i had also used another audio source but in browser it shows one audio <br>
          Looks like you need the help of css and javascript. if i lern i will update my page.</p>
