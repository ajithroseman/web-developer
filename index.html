 <div class="with_css">
  <p id="with_css">with css the first thing i did was changing background color of all my page and also the text font and color.
     Then I want to put the heading "Hi i am roseman" at the centre, just using text align center in css i did it easily 
     but i was confused at border margin with padding and I was playing  around with those four element and I found out using
     margin you can align the text to center you need to tweak a little bit. This paragraph I designed using margin where I had 
     to remove all the &lt;br&gt; so the text is alighed automatically inside the marging depending upon the margin size.
     So by using css we change the html code, it means we dont use html what we learnt as bigenner. By the way dont forget to 
     use div tag because it is most useful in css.</p>
</div>

  <div  class="i_just">
        <p id="i_just">I just got entered in html world right now my html skill is garbage
        If i have to rate my html skill then it is 1/100% in this html code i 
        am just using h1 tag p tag though i learnt div section footer pre br  sup sub. I edited 
        this paragraph after learning "css" i removed the &lt;br&gt; in html and using css i created
        width using vh and height auto margin 0 on all sides and padding 15px on all side and put 
        the background color pink not exactly a pink color but a custom pink using rgb. And aligning 
        the text as justify in css.

  <div class="so_how">
  <h3 id="so_how">So how did i entered in html, hears my story by the way i 
      used h3 tag for this statement.</h3>
  </div>
      <div class="so_i">
        <p id="so_i">
          so i made a mistake using marging at above paragraph i was able to move the whole paragraph
          but it left a blank space at the bottom because i moved the paragraph from bottom to top right
          using position as relative. To solve this i used negative value to top or bottom of margin depending
          upon your needs. I got this idea from google.But i was not satisfied it created alot of problem. After
          lot of trouble i found about "float" this element is best for placing side to side The only downside 
          of this method is you cannot write html at last let me explain with an example. look at the "css heading"
           which is at top right i wrote inside div below menu in css using float right the same i did with paragraph
           with background blue the whole paragraph i wrote below "update about topics i studied" and used float to 
           place it at right.

     <p id="again_using"> using p tag for my story. I am B.E EEE graduate my origin
        plan was to do some electrical job but i choose to do a corse on 
        programming microcontroller The reason was simple the course 
        teacher promised me that if I complete the course he will provide 
        me a job with a decent salary.So I finished the cource in 6 months 
        i was able to program pic microcontroller such a way that connecting 
        seven segment display automatically the number from 0 to 9 it displays 
        yeah i did  various project.
        Now i know C program wich was used to code microcontroller learning c program
         gave me a basic idea of what is programming  But after I finished the course
         that guy did not even support me in getting jobs well I was cheated that broke my
        heart.he only gave me course completion certificate but that was not 
        any helpful after that  i went to several jobs that does not require any
        degree.I was insulted at jobs sometimes that even pissed me then I 
        thaught why dont i start a computer shop because at that time i was 
        working in computer shop while i was working there i used to do 
        computer and laptop service and i was way better than the person 
        who was working there for more than 6 years of expierence That 
        encoraged me to start own shop.I did start a shop where i was 
        covering computer laptop and smartphone services.even though 
        i had so much of talent the location to start the job was not  right 
        because i choosed a location where most people were uneducated
        my shops ws not visible from main road more important thing is 
        if i ask service fees they cannot afford it the peoples were also
        so poor so i was searching job online i <em> <q> came across front end 
        developer </q> </em> after  researching i fond you need to lern html css 
        java script and to adition learning git and github will make life lot
        easier</p>

    <h3>Going to discuss about table content</h3>
    <p>To be honest I actually messed up creating table content I used lots of  "&amp;nbsp;".To display &amp;nbsp; i wrote & without <br>
      space amp to align the text and I also use br tag so the content may look clean I managed to learn <q>&amp;nbsp and &amp;amp </q>from internet<br>
       and also learned table tag from pdf but I need to improve more. Some times i forget how to use colspan = <q>4</q> That it for now. </p>

  <p>In India cars consume diesel or petrol as fuel apart from them there are cng and ev cars but cng gas station are limited and ev are just
    evolving so people mainly go with petrol or diesel varient. A good car cost starts from 10 Lacks to 20 lacks you get cars less than 10 lacks but 
    lots of cost cutting has been done and also tech wise they are limite. Some cars that cost around 10.5 to 12 Lacks are best value obously your choice is
